##### I made this project in the 1st year of my college and won the 2nd prize in Technova (hosted by CSI department of college).
##### Smartometer is a Web Application that reduces the cost of hiring people to snap photos of electricity and water meters.

<p> The Smartometer is a Web portal where people can check their meterâ€™s reading live with a report. The UI/UX design of the application is very simple, such that people can check their readings instantly and pay the bill.
