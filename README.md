## Earlier I had a node version of this application. Now I am trying to make a Django version of the application.

#### PS: When I made the node app, I made many nooby mistakes like not adding gitignore, misarrangement of folders,etc. In the django version, These nooby mistakes are not made.

### Commits are also given proper title in the django version


##### I made this project in the 1st year of my college and won the 2nd prize in Technova (hosted by CSI department of college).
##### Smartometer is a Web Application that reduces the cost of hiring people to snap photos of electricity and water meters.

The Smartometer is a Web portal where people can check their meterâ€™s reading live with a report. The UI/UX design of the application is very simple, such that people can check their readings instantly and pay the bill.
